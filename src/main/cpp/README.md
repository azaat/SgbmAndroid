# Native core of SgbmAndroid library

This directory contains the native implementation of the SGBM-based depth estimation algorithm.

## Description

[StereoSGBM](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.5/d2/d85/classcv_1_1StereoSGBM.html) from OpenCV is used to
calculate depth given a pair of images and calibration parameters. The result is an array of
floating-point numbers representing depth of each pixel of the estimated depth map.

**Calibration parameters** should be stored in a format accepted by
[FileStorage](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.5/da/d56/classcv_1_1FileStorage.html) from OpenCV. The
parameters are:

1. Maps of `x` and `y` values needed to prepare each image of the image pair (4 maps in total) for
   depth estimation with OpenCV's
   [remap](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.5/da/d54/group__imgproc__transform.html#gab75ef31ce5cdfb5c44b6da5f3b908ea4)
   method.
2. A perspective transformation matrix `Q` used to create a 3D representation of image disparity
   with OpenCV's
   [reprojectImageTo3D](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.5/d9/d0c/group__calib3d.html#ga1bc1152bd57d63bc524204f21fde6e02)
   method.

**Image pair** is a pair of left and right photos of something taken roughly at the same moment (if
the scene being shot is dynamic), from the same perspective and with some distance between them (
also known as a *baseline*). Images should be compatible with OpenCV's
[imdecode](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.5/d4/da8/group__imgcodecs.html#ga26a67788faa58ade337f8d28ba0eb19e)
method.

## Project structure

The project consists of the following directories:

- `examples` – usage examples (see below)
- `external` - 3rd-party libraries
- `include` – public headers to include when importing this CMake project
- `src` – source code

## Build

This project requires [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) 4.5.5 or later. You can either
manually download and install it, or run `BuildOpenCV.cmake` script that will download and build
OpenCV for you.

If you already have OpenCV, you can build this project with CMake:

```shell
# In this project's root directory (where the top level CMakeLists.txt is)
cmake .          # Configure the build
cmake --build .  # Start the build
```

### Running OpenCV build script

`BuildOpenCV.cmake` can download the required version of OpenCV and build it with the optimal
configuration. OpenCV will then reside in `build/opencv-build-<optional suffix>`, where this project
will search for it first.

The script can be run as follows:

```shell
cmake <options> -P BuildOpenCV.cmake
```

In most cases no options are needed, as they are going to be inferred from the system by CMake. But
if you plan to build the project for some other platform, you might need to specify the following
options in the form of `-D<variable>=<value>`:

- `BUILD_DIR_SUFFIX` -- suffix to append to OpenCV build directory name (defaults to none)
- `CMAKE_GENERATOR` -- a generator to use (for example, `Ninja`, defaults to system default)
- `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` -- path to a CMake toolchain file (defaults to none)
- `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` -- C/C++ compiler to use (for example, `clang`
  /`clang++` or a path to a compiler, defaults to system default)
- `ANDROID_ABI` -- if building for Android, for which ABI to build (should be one of
  the [supported ABIs](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis), defaults to the ABI from the
  selected toolchain if any)
- `ADD_ANDROID_ABI_CHECK` -- whether to modify `OpenCVConfig-version.cmake` with an additional check
  for Android ABI compatibility (`ON` or `OFF`, disabled by default)
- `ANDROID_ARM_NEON` -- if building for Android, whether to let OpenCV make use of Neon or not (`ON`
  or `OFF`, disabled by default)

The toolchain file specified can influence the other variables default values.

For example, if you want to build for Android with ABI `armeabi-v7a` and Neon support, having NDK
installed in the system, the command to run the script will be something like:

```shell
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="<NDK path>/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake" \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="<NDK path>/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/<platform>/bin/clang<extension>" \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="<NDK path>/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/<platform>/bin/clang++<extension>" \
      -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a \
      -DANDROID_ARM_NEON=ON \
      -DADD_ANDROID_ABI_CHECK=ON \
      -P BuildOpenCV.cmake
```

### Generating a language interface

To generate an interface for Java, Objective-C, Python, and some other languages modify the
configure command as follows:

```shell
cmake -DSCAPIX_BRIDGE=<language> .
```

[Scapix](https://github.com/scapix-com/scapix) is used for this -- see its page for the set of the
supported languages.

The interface will be placed in the corresponding subdirectory of `generated` directory after the
build.

## Usage examples

Files in `examples` directory demonstrate how to use this project for depth estimation.

- `GetDepthExample.cpp` accepts three CLI arguments: path to the file with calibration parameters,
  path to the left image and path to the right image – using them, it estimates depth and prints the
  resulting array of floating-point numbers to `stdout`.
